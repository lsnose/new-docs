At Mintlify, creating an API reference is made easy with our ability to parse your pre-existing files 
and create interactive playgrounds for users to start testing instantly.

There are currently two ways to set up your API reference with our interactive API playground.
1. [Use OpenAPI](/api-playground/setup/openapi)
2. [Use MDX files](/api-playground/setup/mdx)

If you are looking to generate OpenAPI definition from your API, read [here](https://swagger.io/specification/) to learn more.
