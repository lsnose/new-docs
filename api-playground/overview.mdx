The API playground is an interactive environment to make requests and preview an API endpoint. 
You can set up this feature by using either OpenAPI or MDX files. Learn more about it in [setting up your API Reference](/api-playground/setup)

<Info>
  Autogenerating API pages with OpenAPI will automatically generate API
  playground. Read more about using OpenAPI with Mintlify
  [here](/api-playground/setup/openapi).
